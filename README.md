# Project Overview

Deploying a ML Model to Cloud Application Platform with FastAPI

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to deploy in Render (a cloud application platform),
a web service that predicts the salary of a person given some socioeconomic details.

![Live post](https://github.com/moicesc/nd0821-c3-Deploying-a-ML-Model-with-FastAPI/blob/master/screenshots/live_post.png?raw=true)

The model used is a Random Forest Classifier trained using the *_Census Income_* data
retrieved from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

## Running Files

The project (maybe) run in the following link: http://census-mldevops.onrender.com/

    Note: The cloud app service might be suspended to avoid charges XD (sorry not sorry)

The project can also run locally by running the `main.py` file.

### Dependencies for local execution
* `python3.8`

To run the project, first you need a virtual environment with the required packages 
installed (defined in the `requirements.txt` file)
